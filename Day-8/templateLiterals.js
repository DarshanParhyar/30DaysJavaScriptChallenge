//Task 1: Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.

const name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(greeting);


//Task 2: Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.

const multiLineString = `This is a multi-line string.
It spans multiple lines,
and it's really convenient to use template literals!`;
console.log(multiLineString);
