# 30DaysJavaScriptChallenge

This repository contains code for the 30DaysJavaScriptChallenges and challenges assigned by [Sir Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) (Char aur Code).

## [Day 1: Variables and Data Types](https://github.com/DarshanParhyar/30DaysJavaScriptChallenge/tree/main/Day-1)

### Activities

#### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
1. **Task 1**: Using `var`
   - Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.

2. **Task 2**: Using `let`
   - Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
3. **Task 3**: Using `const`
   - Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 3: Data Types
4. **Task 4**: Different Data Types
   - Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
5. **Task 5**: Reassigning `let` Variable
   - Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

#### Activity 5: Understanding `const` and Reassigning `const` Variable
6. **Task 6**: Reassigning `const` Variable
   - Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

### Feature Requests

1. **Variable Types Console Log**
   - Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

2. **Reassignment Demo**
   - Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## Day 2: [Operators](https://github.com/DarshanParhyar/30DaysJavaScriptChallenge/tree/main/Day-2)

### Activities

#### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
1. **Task 1**: Addition
   - Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

2. **Task 2**: Subtraction
   - Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

3. **Task 3**: Multiplication
   - Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

4. **Task 4**: Division
   - Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

5. **Task 5**: Remainder
   - Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 2: Assignment Operators
6. **Task 6**: Addition Assignment
   - Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

7. **Task 7**: Subtraction Assignment
   - Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 3: Comparison Operators
8. **Task 8**: Greater Than and Less Than
   - Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.

9. **Task 9**: Greater Than or Equal and Less Than or Equal
   - Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.

10. **Task 10**: Equality and Strict Equality
    - Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 4: Logical Operators
11. **Task 11**: Logical AND
    - Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

12. **Task 12**: Logical OR
    - Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

13. **Task 13**: Logical NOT
    - Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 5: Ternary Operator
14. **Task 14**: Ternary Operator
    - Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

### Feature Requests

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script**
   - Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

2. **Comparison and Logical Operators Script**
   - Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

3. **Ternary Operator Script**
   - Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
